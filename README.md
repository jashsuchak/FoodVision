# FoodVision

The FoodVision project utilizes a custom dataset specifically designed to classify images into three categories: steak, sushi, and pizza. It includes preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training.
The project implements a TinyVGG model, a lightweight convolutional neural network, to accurately classify the images into the three predefined classes.
